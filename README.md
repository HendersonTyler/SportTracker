### Using Selenium and Python to export Strava GPX to Garmin Connect

I use a Samsung Active watch to track my paddling. The Samsung Health app uploads to Strava, but not Garmin Connect, and won't export a file that can be uploaded to Garmin. I wrote this program to automate the basic task of changing the details of the activity in Strava, exporting the GPX file, upload to Garmin, and changing the details again.
